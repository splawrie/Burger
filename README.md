# Burger

The Eat-Da-Burger app is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page.  At this point the  burger is waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour It button. When the user clicks the Devour It button, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
